Story:
Imagine you’re back in Königsberg with those seven bridges connecting different parts of the city. Each piece of land (the four areas) is like a dot or node, and each bridge is a line or relationship that connects those dots.

Nodes (Land Areas):

Think of each land mass in the city as a node (or dot). These are the parts of the city you can walk through, like islands or districts.
Example: In Königsberg, there were four areas of land, each one is a node in your mental map.
Relationships (Bridges):

The bridges connecting the land areas are relationships (or edges). These are the paths you can take to move from one node (land area) to another.
Example: The seven bridges in Königsberg are the lines connecting different land areas (nodes).
Visualization:
Picture a map with dots (land areas = nodes) and lines (bridges = relationships).
For example, if you’re trying to cross from node A (one piece of land) to node B (another piece of land), you’d cross a bridge (relationship).
How It All Works:
Now imagine that this idea of nodes and relationships applies to everything:

In social graphs, people are nodes. Michael and Sarah are nodes. If they’re married, we draw a line (relationship) between their nodes labeled MARRIED_TO.
At work, Michael and Graph Inc. are nodes. Since Michael works at the company, we draw another line labeled WORKS_AT.
Mental Image:
Nodes = Things (people, places, objects).
Relationships = Connections between things (friendships, marriages, workplaces).
In Königsberg, land areas are nodes, and bridges are relationships. When you apply this to other examples, remember that things (nodes) get interesting only when they are connected by relationships.

Long-Term Memory Hook:
Think of nodes as the places or people you care about (e.g., you and your friends in a social network). Think of relationships as the connections (e.g., friendships, workplaces, marriages). In Königsberg, it was the bridges (relationships) connecting the land masses (nodes).

By visualizing it this way and connecting it to real-life examples like people and places, this concept will stick in your long-term memory. Just remember: nodes are things, and relationships are how they connect—just like the land areas and bridges in the Seven Bridges of Königsberg!
